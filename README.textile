h1. TwitterSay

This program receives DMs on twitter from a specified account and executes a say command in terminal that will speak the actual text from the dm (It polls Twitter every 25 seconds or so which is the Twitter API rate limit).
Every time you open a terminal window it will start a daemon that listens for DMs.

This was intended for use at work to anthropromorphize our iMacs. They tend to always be on and we use terminal quite often so the daemon is usually activated. If you exit out of terminal the daemon should still be running.

h2. Requirements

Ruby with the 'twibot' gem installed
Mac OS X with a working 'say' command
